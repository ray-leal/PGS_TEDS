# GWAS Summary Statistics Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for common column headers found in Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics files. Understanding these terms is crucial for interpreting GWAS results.

| Header | Meaning | Convention/Interpretation | Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 (Effect Allele) | The allele whose effect is being reported in the BETA or OR column. | Sometimes called EA (Effect Allele). **Crucially, confirm which allele (A1 or A2) is the effect allele from the study's documentation.** | Defines which specific nucleotide change (e.g., changing from a 'G' to an 'A') the reported effect size corresponds to. |
| A2 (Other Allele) | The other allele present at the SNP locus. | Sometimes called NEA (Non-Effect Allele) or REF. | Defines the baseline allele against which the effect of A1 is measured. |
| BETA (β) | The estimated effect size for a quantitative trait (e.g., height, blood pressure, gene expression level). | Represents the change in the trait value (in standard deviations if standardized, or original units otherwise) for each additional copy of the A1 (effect) allele. Positive BETA means A1 increases the trait value; negative means A1 decreases it. | Quantifies the magnitude and direction of the association for continuous traits. |
| BP | Base Pair position (coordinate) of the SNP on the chromosome. | **Important: You must know which reference genome build was used (e.g., GRCh37/hg19 or GRCh38/hg38) as positions differ between builds.** | Provides the precise location of the variant. |
| CHR | Chromosome on which the SNP is located. | Typically numbers 1-22, or X, Y, MT (Mitochondrial). | Locates the variant within the genome. |
| chr:pos | A combined identifier string representing the chromosome and base pair position. | Example: 1:1234567 means chromosome 1, position 1234567. | An alternative or additional way to identify the variant's location, often used for quick lookups or compatibility. |
| DIRE / Direction / effects | Likely related to meta-analysis, summarizing the direction of effect observed across the different studies included. | Might be a string of '+' and '-' signs (e.g., ++-++?), where each symbol represents a study, '+' means A1 increased the trait (or risk), '-' means A1 decreased it, and '?' might mean the SNP wasn't available or the effect was uncertain in that study. **The exact format requires documentation.** | Helps assess the consistency of the association across different cohorts. Consistent direction strengthens the evidence. |
| EAF (Effect Allele Frequency) | The frequency (proportion, ranging from 0 to 1) of the A1 allele (the effect allele) in the studied population. |  | Tells you how common the effect allele is. A variant can have a large effect size (BETA/OR) but if its EAF is very low, it affects fewer people. |
| EAF_HRC | Effect Allele Frequency specifically derived from or harmonized with the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) imputation panel. |  | Provides EAF information relative to a standard large reference panel. |
| FREQ | Allele frequency, but ambiguous without context. | Could be EAF (frequency of A1) or MAF (Minor Allele Frequency), or even frequency of A2. **Check documentation.** If EAF is also present, FREQ might refer specifically to A1 or potentially A2. | Provides allele frequency information, but requires careful interpretation based on study specifics. |
| FRQ_A_23212 / FRQ_A_38691 | Frequency of an allele (probably A1/Effect Allele) within a specific subset of the data, perhaps Cohort 'A' or Cases ('Affected'), with the given sample size (e.g., 23,212 individuals) indicated in the column name. |  | Provides allele frequency stratified by a specific group (e.g., cases). |
| FRQ_U_151447 / FRQ_U_186843 | Frequency of an allele (probably A1/Effect Allele) within another subset, perhaps Cohort 'U' or Controls ('Unaffected'), with the given sample size indicated in the column name. |  | Provides allele frequency stratified by a specific group (e.g., controls). |
| HetDf | Degrees of Freedom for heterogeneity tests (like Cochran's Q) in a meta-analysis. | Usually k - 1, where k is the number of studies included in the meta-analysis for that SNP. | Parameter used in heterogeneity statistical tests. |
| HetISqt (I²) | The I² statistic, measuring heterogeneity in a meta-analysis. | Represents the percentage (0-100%) of the total variation in effect estimates across studies that is due to genuine heterogeneity (differences in true effects) rather than chance. High I² (>75%) suggests substantial heterogeneity. | Assesses the consistency of effect sizes across different studies in a meta-analysis. |
| HetPVa | The P-value associated with a test for heterogeneity (e.g., Cochran's Q test) in a meta-analysis. | A small P-value (e.g., < 0.05 or < 0.10) suggests statistically significant heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies. | Indicates whether observed differences in effects between studies are likely greater than expected by chance. |
| INFO | Imputation Information Score (typically ranges from 0 to 1). | Measures the quality or certainty of imputed genotypes for SNPs that were not directly measured on the genotyping chip. A score of 1 means perfect certainty, lower scores indicate less certainty. | Low INFO scores (e.g., < 0.3 or < 0.8, depending on threshold) indicate potentially unreliable association results for that SNP. |
| MAF (Minor Allele Frequency) | The frequency (proportion, ranging from 0 to 0.5) of the less common allele at that SNP locus in the studied population. | MAF = EAF if EAF ≤ 0.5; otherwise, MAF = 1 - EAF. | Indicates the frequency of the rarer allele, often used for filtering or describing variants. |
| N | The total number of individuals included in the analysis for this specific SNP. | This can sometimes vary slightly SNP-by-SNP due to genotype missingness or quality control filters. | Statistical power depends heavily on sample size. Larger N generally leads to more precise estimates (smaller SE) and lower P-values for true associations. |
| NCAS (N Cases) | The number of cases (individuals with the trait/disease) included in the analysis for this SNP, specifically in a case-control study design. |  | Relevant for interpreting OR and power in case-control studies. |
| NCON (N Controls) | The number of controls (individuals without the trait/disease) included in the analysis for this SNP, specifically in a case-control study design. |  | Relevant for interpreting OR and power in case-control studies. |
| Neff | Effective Sample Size. | Often calculated for case-control studies as 4 / (1/NCAS + 1/NCON) or adjusted in meta-analyses or studies with related individuals. Represents the sample size of an "ideal" study that would have the same statistical power as the actual study for that SNP. | Provides a standardized measure of sample size, useful for comparing power across different study designs or meta-analyses. |
| NEFFDIV2 | Not a standard term. | Could literally mean Neff / 2. Its specific purpose would depend heavily on the context or software generating it. **Requires documentation.** | Unknown without context, likely an intermediate value for specific calculations. |
| ngt | Number of Genotypes Tested/Available. | Might sometimes be 0 or slightly different from N if a SNP was poorly imputed or failed QC. | Can indicate data quality or availability for that specific SNP. |
| OR (Odds Ratio) | The estimated effect size for a binary trait (e.g., disease presence/absence, case/control). | Represents the multiplicative change in the odds of having the trait (being a case) for each additional copy of the A1 (effect) allele. OR > 1 implies increased odds, OR < 1 implies decreased odds. | Quantifies the magnitude and direction of association for binary traits. |
| ORIBP | Not a standard GWAS column header. | Might stand for "Original Base Pair" if coordinates were adjusted (lifted over) from another genome build, but this is speculative. **Check the study's documentation.** | Unknown without documentation. |
| P (P-value) | The probability of observing the current association result (or a more extreme one) purely by chance, if the null hypothesis (no true association) were true. | Lower P-values indicate stronger statistical evidence against the null hypothesis. A common threshold for genome-wide significance is P < 5x10⁻⁸. | The primary measure of statistical significance in GWAS. |
| p_corrected | A P-value that has been adjusted for multiple testing. | Used when performing many tests simultaneously to control the overall rate of false positives. Standard genome-wide significance (5x10⁻⁸) is already a form of correction; this column might represent a different or additional correction. | Used when performing many tests simultaneously to control the overall rate of false positives. |
| p_stouffer | A P-value resulting from combining evidence (often Z-scores weighted by sample size) from multiple independent studies (meta-analysis) using Stouffer's method. |  | Represents the overall significance of association across multiple datasets included in a meta-analysis. |
| REF.FREQ | Frequency of the Reference Allele (often A2, but depends on definition within the specific dataset). | Should typically be 1 - EAF. | Provides the frequency of the allele not designated as the effect allele. |
| SE (Standard Error) | The standard error of the effect size estimate (BETA or log(OR)). | Measures the precision of the effect size estimate. A smaller SE indicates a more precise estimate. | Used to calculate confidence intervals around the effect size and the Z-score/P-value. |
| SNP / SNPID | Unique identifier for the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (genetic variant) being tested. | Often an "rs" ID from dbSNP (e.g., rs123456), but can also be custom IDs or chromosome:position formats. | Tells you which specific variant the row's results refer to. |
| Z | The Z-score, which is the effect size divided by its standard error (Z = BETA / SE or Z = log(OR) / SE). | Measures the strength of the association in terms of standard deviations away from the null hypothesis (no effect). Larger absolute values indicate stronger evidence against the null. | Directly related to the P-value; can be used to calculate it. |
| z_se | Not standard. Most likely refers to the SE (Standard Error) column. | It's the standard error used to calculate the Z-score (Z = Effect / SE). Less likely, it could refer to the SE of the Z-score itself (usually assumed 1 under the null). **Check documentation.** | Likely represents the precision of the effect estimate (same as SE). |
